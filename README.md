## Use Case Descriptions
- Steps 1–2 are your lightest fills, ideal for page or component backgrounds.
- Steps 3–5 cover hover/focus/active states and other interactive elements.
- Steps 6–8 are for borders, dividers, and focus rings (with step 8 sometimes used for disabled text in neutral scales).
- Steps 9–10 provide solid color fills—pair with high-contrast text (usually white, except in very bright “accent” palettes where dark text may work).
- Steps 11–12 give you text colors: step 11 for secondary/link text, step 12 for primary, high-contrast text.
